# Meme Stash: Technology Choices

This document explains the technology choices made for the Meme Stash application based on the recommendations and research.

## Frontend Framework: Vue.js

**Rationale:**
- Vue.js offers a gentler learning curve compared to React, making it more accessible for development
- Excellent for small to medium-sized projects like our meme library
- More efficient in handling updates with less manual intervention
- Strong PWA support through the Vue CLI PWA plugin
- Flexible and scalable as the project grows

## Backend Framework: Node.js with Express

**Rationale:**
- Excellent for handling asynchronous operations, which is crucial for media-heavy applications
- Superior performance for handling multiple media uploads simultaneously
- JavaScript across the entire stack simplifies development
- Rich ecosystem for media handling and processing
- Seamless JSON handling for metadata

## Database: PostgreSQL with JSONB

**Rationale:**
- PostgreSQL offers strong JSONB support for flexible data storage
- Better performance with structured data compared to MongoDB
- ACID transaction capabilities ensure data integrity
- Excellent for complex queries and future analytics needs
- Mature and reliable technology with strong community support

## Project Structure: Monorepo

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies development workflow with shared configurations
- Easier to maintain consistency across frontend and backend
- Simplifies deployment and containerization
- Better code sharing and reuse between frontend and backend

## Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose

**Rationale:**
- Ensures consistent development and production environments
- Simplifies deployment across different hosting platforms
- Isolates services for better security and scalability
- Makes self-hosting easier for end users
- Follows best practices for modern web application deployment

## PWA Implementation

**Rationale:**
- Service workers for offline capabilities
- Manifest file for installability
- Responsive design for cross-device compatibility
- Optimized for performance and offline use

These technology choices provide a solid foundation for building a scalable, performant, and user-friendly meme library application that can be easily self-hosted.
